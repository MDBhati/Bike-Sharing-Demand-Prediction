## Abstract
As a convenient, economical, and ecofriendly travel mode, bike-sharing greatly improved urban mobility. However, it is often very difficult to achieve a balanced utilization of shared bikes due to the asymmetric user demand distribution and the insufficient numbers of shared bikes, docks, or parking areas. If we can predict the short-run bike-sharing demand, it will help operating agencies rebalance bike-sharing systems in a timely and efficient way.

## Problem Statement
We are here to explore the bike sharing dataset and build a model to do the following:

Maximize: The availability of bikes to the customer.
Minimize: Minimize the time of waiting to get a bike on rent. The main goal of the project is to: Find factors and causes which influence shortages of bikes and time delay of availing bikes on rent. Using the data provided, this paper aims to analyze the data to determine what variables are correlated with bike demand prediction. Hourly count of bikes for rent will also be predicted.

## Introduction
Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.
The goal of this project is to build a ML model that is able to predict the demand of rental bikes in the city of Seoul. We are provided with the data of weather conditions, office holidays, and the number of bikes rented each hour for 12 months.
